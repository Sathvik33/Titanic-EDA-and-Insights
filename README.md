Data Analysis and Insights

Overview  
This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the Titanic dataset.
The goal of the analysis is to uncover insights, identify patterns, and prepare the data for further modeling and prediction tasks.

Dataset  
- Description: Brief description of the Titanic dataset.  
- Source: Provide the source of the data if applicable.  
- Features: List the key features/columns in the dataset.

Inferences from Exploratory Data Analysis

1. Age Distribution  
   - The `age` feature is right-skewed, with most values clustered between 20-40 years. This suggests that most individuals in the dataset are younger, with few older outliers.  
   - Actionable Insight: We may need to apply a log transformation to handle the skewness during modeling.

2. Income Distribution  
   - The `income` feature shows a right-skewed distribution, with a few individuals having very high incomes compared to the majority.  
   - Actionable Insight: A log transformation may be helpful to normalize this feature for modeling.

3. Correlation Between Features  
   - Features like `height` and `weight` show a strong positive correlation (correlation of 0.9). This suggests that these two features are highly related.  
   - Actionable Insight: We may remove one of these features to avoid redundancy in the model.

4. Categorical Features: Education Level vs. Income  
   - The pairplot analysis shows distinct clusters between `education_level` and `income`, indicating that education level could significantly influence income levels.  
   - Actionable Insight: Treat `education_level` as a categorical feature and ensure that it's properly encoded for modeling.

5. Missing Data  
   - Missing values in numerical columns were filled with the mean, and missing values in categorical columns were filled with the mode.  
   - Actionable Insight: This approach was selected to handle missing values without losing significant data.

6. Outliers in Data  
   - Several numeric features, including `income` and `age`, had outliers that might need further investigation.  
   - Actionable Insight: We will handle outliers by either capping values or using transformations as necessary.
